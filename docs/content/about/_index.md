## Some Advice :)

If there’s one thing I can give you, it’s that if you want anything in life, you have to be relentless. I used to think that avoiding any type of crisis or difficult problem was the only way to achieve great things. My perspective was absolutely wrong. Crisis or danger is not something to avoid, but an opportunity.

Towards the end of my collegiate journey, I've come to realize that solving the most difficult of problems is the only way I can leave the world better off. From revolutionizing energy at Tesla, designing the best planes at Boeing, making education affordable with Scholarship Junkies, to solving aerodynamic/mechanical problems with UWashington Hyperloop.

For me, difficult problems have gone from obstacles to stepping stones. I now aim to improve the world and myself every single hour, constantly auditing my time so that I can better accomplish my goals.

Need some help? Have an idea about the future? Feel more than free to reach out to me :)
